This image represents the first rotation done in the pointCoordinates algorithm.

Legend:

Center black dot: Center of the Earth (CE); (0,0,0) in our coordinate system

Outside black dot: Representation of Given Point (GP) on the Earth's surface relative to the
Center Point (CP) on the Earth's surface. Before rotation, it will not have a Z component, and its
magnitude is determined by the magnitude of the polar vector.

Yellow line: Direction of rotation about the X axis (out of the screen)


This first rotation will result in us knowing the direction of GP from CE. For this rotation, we
assume the center of the image is at point Latitude: 0 Longitude: 0. After this rotation, we
rotate about the Y and Z axes by the latitude and longitude of the given CP so that we are left
with a vector from CE to the actual GP.
