This image represents viewAngle and pointAngle. It is a focused view of the image in Overview.png.

Legend:

Yellow dot: Satellite
Red angle: viewAngle
Blue angle: pointAngle
Black dots: Center Point (CP) and Given Point (GP)

This image shows what viewAngle and pointAngle. These two angles are used to find the magnitude of 
the final polar vector in polarDistance. In pointCoordinates, these angles are found from the 
altitude of the satellite and the magnitude of the polar vector.
