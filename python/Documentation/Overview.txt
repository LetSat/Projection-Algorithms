This image represents the basic points and vectors described in the algorithms.

Legend:

Yellow dot - Satellite
Black dots - Center Point (CP) and Given Point (GP)
Green line - EarthToCenter vector
Red line - EarthToPoint vector
Blue line - Viewing Plane (VP)

From the satellite, there are two lines tangent to the Earth. The area inside these lines is the 
portion of the Earth that is visible to the satellite. Between the two tangent lines is the VP,
which is also perpendicular to EarthToCenter. Also depicted in this image are the CenterToCam and
PointToCam vectors, which are referenced in the code for the polarDistance function.
